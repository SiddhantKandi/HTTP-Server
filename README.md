# 📰 RSS Aggregator API (Go)

A fully-featured RSS feed aggregator and RESTful API built with **Go**.  
It allows users to subscribe to RSS feeds, fetch latest content, and manage personal subscriptions — all powered by PostgreSQL, SQLC, and Goose.

---

## ✅ Features

- Add, follow, and unfollow RSS feeds
- Fetch and store the latest posts from followed feeds
- Create and authenticate users with secure API keys
- RESTful API endpoints with token-based authentication
- PostgreSQL database with SQL migrations and Go code generation

## 🧠 What is RSS?

**RSS (Really Simple Syndication)** is a standard XML format for delivering regularly changing web content like:

- Blog posts
- News articles
- Podcasts

Each RSS feed contains a list of items (posts) with fields like:

- `title`
- `url`
- `description`
- `published_at`

Your application reads these feeds, stores the posts in a database, and lets users fetch content from feeds they follow.

Verify installation:

sqlc version
goose -version
2. Set Up Environment
Create a .env file:

DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/rss_aggregator?sslmode=disable
3. Run Database Migrations
goose -dir sql/schema postgres $DATABASE_URL up
4. Generate Go Code from SQL
sqlc generate
